## My Web Odyssey

My first encounter with the internet was completely spontaneous.  
In the late ’90s, few people in Moscow had home internet, usually it was dial-up, paid by the minute, and getting a stable connection felt like winning the lottery. A dedicated line? That was pure sci-fi.

In 1999, I was studying at college. Next door was a computer club where teenagers spent nights playing **Quake 3**, **Unreal Tournament**, **StarCraft**, and **Ultima Online**. It was the kind of place where time disappeared and all your money evaporated with it. I didn’t go there often, I preferred quieter spots, but one day, my friends and I decided to drop by.

That day, I sat down in front of an old CRT monitor, connected to the internet for the first time in my life. Most guys around me immediately went to explore the kind of websites that still dominate global traffic (no need to elaborate). But I had a different idea, I wanted to **leave a mark**, something like a digital “Slava was here” carved on the wooden gate of cyberspace.

I quickly found a free web host with a third-level domain like `example.narod.ru` and registered a site.  
Without knowing HTML or anything else, I managed to create a tiny page that simply said:  
> “Welcome to the website of Slava Trofimov.”

I was ridiculously proud of it.  
That feeling, seeing my own words live on the internet, completely hooked me.  
That moment quietly decided my entire future.


## From Curiosity to Creation

Over the next few years, I kept improving my site.  
I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and later PHP. Around 2002, I created a fan website for the Canadian singer **Avril Lavigne**, `avril.ru`.  
It quickly became popular: thousands of visitors daily, a buzzing forum, blogs, online radio, fan-made galleries, etc.  
Working on that project taught me my first real lessons in **web design**, **user experience**, and **community building**.

That’s when I realized: this isn’t just a hobby. This is what I want to do with my life.


## Leveling Up

While studying Computer Science at university, I landed my first job as a **Front-End Developer**.  
At the same time, I took freelance projects and soon launched my own small agency called **Web Solution**.

We offered everything, from logo design and branding to website development, hosting, and SEO.  
I built full projects from the ground up, architecture, UI design, coding, deployment, and maintenance.  
We mainly worked with **Joomla** and **OpenCart**, later **WordPress**, and I learned every stage of production, front to back.

That experience shaped me into a developer who could see the full picture, not just code, but the entire system behind it.


## The Entrepreneur Chapter

After several years running Web Solution, I sold the business and launched my own e-commerce project, **iMoan.ru**, an online store focused on wellness and intimate health.  
I created the brand, built the site, managed logistics, and ran a highly successful SEO campaign.  
The business grew fast and did well, but after a few years, life threw a new quest my way.


## The Canadian Reset

When I moved to Canada, I had to start over from scratch.  
Nobody really cares what you did before crossing the ocean, and that’s fair. You have to earn your place again.

My first job was at **Electrolight**, a lighting store, where I maintained their e-commerce site.  
It paid almost nothing, but it gave me the one thing I needed most, **Canadian experience**.

Soon after, I joined **EvolutionInDesignZ**, a Toronto-based agency that later became **codepxl**.  
I spent almost **six years** there, growing from a front-end developer into a **Senior Front-End Developer**, and eventually a **Full Stack Engineer**.  
I led small teams, mentored juniors and interns, and worked on dozens of projects across different industries.  
It was fun, fast-paced, and incredibly rewarding. Those were my “grind and grow” years.


## The Leap Forward

In 2023, I joined **Jobscan** as a **Senior Full Stack Engineer**, and that was a turning point.  
Working in a startup environment opened up a new level of technical and creative challenge.  
I started integrating **AI** into production systems, building agentic workflows, automations, and experimenting with custom LLM setups.  
It felt like stepping into the future, where every piece of code could think, reason, and adapt.


## Twenty-Five Years Later

And here I am, about **25 years** after that first little “Welcome to my website” page, still here, still building for the web.  
Still curious, still learning.  
But now, the web feels alive in a completely new way.

I’m not just a Web Engineer anymore, I’m an **engineer of interaction between humans and machines**.  
Every new project feels like a new quest, every challenge like a boss battle, and every solved bug like a small personal victory.

I’ve never regretted the path I chose.  
I do what I love, and I love what I do, that’s all I ever wanted.
